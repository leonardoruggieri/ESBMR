# Extended Stochastic Block Models for Recommendations (ESBMR)
This repository contains the code used to implement the Extended Stochastic Block Model for Recommendations.
The ESBMR is an extension to the recommendation setting of the ESBM by Legramanti, Rigon and Durante (2020): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08569.pdf.

The model has been developed for my Master of Science thesis in Economics at Bocconi University.
